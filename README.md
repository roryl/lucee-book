##What is Lucee good for?
Lucee is a server side technology designed for building full stack HTML & Javascript web applications, REST applications, microservics and CLI applications. It has an extensive standard library and many included services, such that if you are building a web based application, Lucee contains most of what you need without having to track down additional 3rd party libraries.

##What is Lucee *not* good for?
Lucee cannot be used for creating native mobile applications and generally is not suitable for desktop applications because it requires running the Lucee server. Although, Lucee is a great choice for your mobile application backend.
